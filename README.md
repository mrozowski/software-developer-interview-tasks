# software-developer-interview-tasks
I subscribe Daily Interview Pro which sends me everyday a new interview task that are asked by the most popular companies such as Microsoft, Uber or Apple. <br>
When I have free time I try to solve some of the daily tasks to be better prepared for job interview. All of them are writen in Python using Jupyter notebook.
