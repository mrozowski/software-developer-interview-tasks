I subscribe to Daily Interview Pro which sends me every day a new interview task that is asked by the most popular companies such as Microsoft, Uber, or Apple. <br>
When I have free time I try to solve some of the daily tasks to be better prepared for a job interviews. All of them are written in Python using Jupyter notebook.
